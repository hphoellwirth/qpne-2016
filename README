# Description
The project computes a quasi-perfect Nash equilibria in 2-player games.

# More
This project was part of my bachelor thesis "Computing a Perfect Nash Equilibrium for 2-player and n-player Games" in 2016 at the University of Edinburgh (BSc Computer Science and Management Science).

# Acknowledgment
The algorithm is based on the paper "Computing a quasi-perfect equilibrium of a two-player game" by P. B. Miltersen and T. B. Sørensen (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-009-0440-6).
The implementation is based on Bernhard von Stengel's source code for computing perfect equilibria (rather than quasi-perfect): stengel/ecta2002
